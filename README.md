# 🧩 FLOWIE v2.5

FLOWIE is a structured, LLM-native script for analyzing and refining complex UX flows. Built to help product designers, strategists, and researchers work with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Builder platforms like V0 or Figma Make.

Use FLOWIE to:
- Generate multiple wireframe options quickly
- Evaluate usability tradeoffs
- Produce structured outputs for AI builder tools
- Reduce prompt churn and decision fatigue

## 🚀 How to Use

You have two easy options:

### 1. Upload the `.txt` or `.xml` file into your LLM
Then say:
``` 
Use this FLOWIE script to analyze a UI flow I'm about to describe.
```

Or with a slash command:
``` 
/slash_flowie_upload "Use this FLOWIE script to review the following UI steps..."
```

### 2. Copy and paste the FLOWIE content between `<instructions>` tags into your LLM
This is helpful if file upload isn’t available. The script will prompt you for missing info and guide you step-by-step.

- **Susan Weisz** — Used FLOWIE and Figma Make to create a working prototype for a VDN Assignment Simulator.
- **Mubarak** — Applied FLOWIE to BRIDGEGOOD’s apprentice database; shaped improvements in accessibility, onboarding clarity, and schema integration.

### 🧠 Design Feedback
These contributors provided critique and strategic suggestions that helped shape FLOWIE's structure, clarity, and scope:

- **Steve McMahon** — Gave detailed critique on file clarity, onboarding copy, selection metric logic, and inline usability comments.
- **Michael Paulus** — Recommended tool-specific schema selection and slash command initiation. Floated wizard-style model, which helped affirm FLOWIE's prompt-first focus.
- **Vamsi Batchu** — Shared perspective on AI hallucination risks, balancing context, and LLM visual comprehension limits.
- **Robert “Bobby” Renteria** — Provided live feedback via Loom on language clarity, terminology comprehension, and user onboarding expectations. Suggested alternate interface ideas (e.g. form-based input), which helped clarify FLOWIE’s focus as a scriptable, adaptable prompt tool—not a hosted UI.
- **Norm Sun** — Offered microcopy and interaction design feedback that shaped early site experience, helping refine instructional hierarchy.
